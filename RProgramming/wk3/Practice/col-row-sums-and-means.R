# ============================================
# Col/Row sums and means built-in functions
# ============================================

# In stead of using apply to calc the means and sums of a 
# matrix, you can use the following built-in R functions
# that are optimized to do this....
#
# ---------------------------------
# *rowSums = apply(x, 1, sum)
#
# * rowMeans = apply(x, 1, mean)
#
# * colSums = apply(x, 2, sum)
#
# * colMeans = apply(x, 2, mean)
# ---------------------------------
